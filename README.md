# Bubble Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

# Project Description:

This is a web page that visualizes the bubble sorting algorithm. The page contains two buttons labeled "randomize" and "solve," and a number field where the user can specify the length of the array. The "randomize" button generates a new random array of integers of the specified length, and the "solve" button triggers the bubble sorting algorithm and displays the sorting process visually on the web page.
